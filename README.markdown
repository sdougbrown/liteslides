<h1>SimpleSlider: An even lighter slider framework</h1>
<p>Based on Orbit by Zurb, this strips out all of the goofy css and is a purely javascript solution for very custom sliders.</p>

<p>This is meant to be a barebones starting point, so I won't be writing any default css - I may put together a demo after I'm done refactoring orbit... :)</p>
