<h1>_liteslide: An even lighter slider framework</h1>
<p>This started life as Orbit by Zurb (1.2.3, not the version that was actually forked), but I stripped out all of the goofy css and this is now a purely javascript solution for very custom sliders.</p>

<p>This is meant to be a barebones starting point, so I won't be writing any default css - I may put together a demo after I'm done refactoring... :)</p>
